Flappy Bird was a side-scrolling game featuring 2D retro style graphics.
The objective was to direct a flying bird, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes.
If the player touches the pipes, they lose.
The bird briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps space; 
if the space is not tapped, the bird falls because of gravity; 
each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point.
